    "Dietary supplements are a growing part of the health and wellness market, and many consumers now buy products such as vitamins, protein powders, and probiotics through e-commerce platforms. Unlike prescription medications, dietary supplements are not strictly regulated before they are sold, which means consumers often rely on visible product information when making purchasing decisions.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Because of this, attributes such as price, brand reputation, and especially online reviews play an important role in shaping supplement sales online.\n",

    "We hypothesize that price, customer ratings, review count, and brand are significantly associated with dietary supplement sales. Specifically, we expect review count and average rating to be positively associated with sales, price to be negatively associated with sales, and sales to differ across brands. Among these attributes, we hypothesize that review count will exhibit the strongest positive association with sales. We define “sales” as either total units sold, revenue generated, or sales rank, depending on data availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that consumer purchasing decisions on e-commerce platforms are strongly influenced by social proof and credibility. In particular, the number of reviews may serve as an indicator of product popularity and trustworthiness, making consumers more likely to purchase items that appear widely used or endorsed by others."

    "Ideal dataset to answer our question\n",
    "\n",
    "To rigorously study which product attributes are most strongly associated with dietary supplement sales on e-commerce platforms, the ideal dataset would be a product-level panel dataset (i.e., repeated measurements over time) covering a large set of dietary supplement items on a single platform (e.g., Amazon). The dataset would include a clear measure of sales performance (ideally true units sold or revenue; otherwise a reliable proxy such as Best Sellers Rank / Sales Rank), along with product attributes such as price, customer rating, number of reviews, and brand.\n",
    "\n",
    "What variables are needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Outcome (sales / sales proxy)\n",
    "    units_sold (preferred) or revenue (GMV), measured daily/weekly\n",
    "    If not available: sales_rank / best_sellers_rank (BSR) as a sales proxy (lower rank typically indicates better sales performance)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key predictors (product attributes)\n",
    "\n",
    "    price (preferably the “buy box” price), plus list_price and discount if available\n",
    "    rating_avg (average star rating)\n",
    "    review_count (number of reviews)\n",
    "    brand (canonical brand name)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Important controls (to reduce confounding)\n",
    "\n",
    "    category / sub_category within dietary supplements (e.g., vitamins, protein, fish oil)\n",
    "    product_age (days since listing / first observed date)\n",
    "    pack_size / servings / net_weight (to compare products fairly; enables price-per-serving)\n",
    "    Optional: prime_eligible, seller_type (Amazon vs third-party), badges (e.g., “Amazon’s Choice”), subscription availability\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How many observations are needed?\n",
    "At minimum, we would want ~1,000 products to fit a baseline multivariable model, but this can be unstable once we include brand and sub-category controls. A more realistic target is 5,000–20,000+ unique products, which supports: (1) brand effects (e.g., top brands vs “Other”), (2) category stratification, and (3) non-linear price relationships. If using time-series/panel data, having multiple time points per product (e.g., 30–180 days) would substantially improve reliability and allow analyses of how changes in price relate to changes in sales proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who/what/how would these data be collected?\n",
    "Ideally, the data would be collected either (1) directly from the platform through an approved data source or third-party API that tracks products over time (e.g., sales rank and price history), or (2) from a reputable public dataset that provides product metadata plus review/rating information. If we build the dataset ourselves via an API, we would define a sampling frame of dietary supplement products and collect daily/weekly snapshots of price, rating, review count, and sales rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would these data be stored/organized?\n",
    "We would store the data in a normalized structure:\n",
    "Products table (products.csv): one row per product (ASIN/product_id) containing stable attributes (brand, category, pack size, etc.).\n",
    "Daily metrics table (daily_metrics.csv): one row per product per date containing time-varying measures (price, rating, review count, sales rank).\n",
    "Mapping/cleaning table (brand_category_map.csv): standardized brand names and cleaned sub-categories.\n",
    " This format supports both cross-sectional modeling and panel/time-series analyses, and makes data cleaning reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Real Datasets\n",
    "1) Kaggle — “Amazon Products Sales Dataset (42K+ items, 2025)”\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikramshah512/amazon-products-sales-dataset-42k-items-2025\n",
    "This Kaggle dataset provides a large collection of Amazon product listings and is suitable for building a product-level dataset for analysis. The data is available via Kaggle download as CSV and can typically be used immediately after importing into Python. The dataset often contains key predictors such as price, rating, review count, brand, and category, though the presence of a direct sales measure (or sales-rank proxy) depends on the specific column schema in the downloaded version. If it includes a sales proxy (e.g., rank) or a “sales” field, it can be used as the primary dataset for our regression/feature-importance analyses; otherwise it still serves as a strong source for product attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Amazon Reviews ’23 (McAuley Lab) — product + review data at scale\n",
    "https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/\n",
    "Amazon Reviews ’23 is a research-grade dataset that contains large-scale Amazon review data and associated product metadata. It can be downloaded from the project website and related hosting (often HuggingFace/GitHub), but it is large and may require filtering to the Health/Dietary Supplements categories and possibly sampling for compute constraints. This dataset is particularly useful for constructing rating averages, review counts, and potentially review-derived features (e.g., sentiment), with timestamps that support time-based aggregation. However, it typically does not provide true sales, so we would use it mainly to study attribute relationships with a sales proxy (if available elsewhere) or as a complementary dataset to enrich our main product table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Keepa API — price history + sales rank history (best for panel data)\n",
    "https://keepaapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_methods.html\n",
    "Keepa is a specialized service that tracks Amazon product history, including price time series and often sales rank (BSR) time series, which aligns closely with our ideal panel dataset structure. Using Keepa generally requires an API key and is subject to usage limits/quotas, so we would need to plan a manageable sampling strategy (e.g., focusing on a subset of dietary supplement products). The most important variables from Keepa for our project would be daily/weekly price, sales rank, and product identifiers and metadata needed to join with brand/category information. This source would allow stronger analyses of how price changes correlate with sales-rank changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Kaggle — “Amazon US Customer Reviews Dataset” (review-focused, best as supplement)\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cynthiarempel/amazon-us-customer-reviews-dataset\n",
    "This Kaggle dataset contains U.S. customer review data and is useful for extracting ratings, review counts, and potentially review-derived features. It is straightforward to access via Kaggle download, but it typically lacks detailed product pricing history and does not include direct sales measures. Therefore, it is best used as a supplementary dataset to enrich product-level reputation variables or to validate patterns seen in a main product-attribute dataset. If the dataset includes product identifiers that can be linked to a product table, we can merge it to compute aggregated reputation measures."
