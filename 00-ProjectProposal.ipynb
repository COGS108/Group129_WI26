    "Dietary supplements are a growing part of the health and wellness market, and many consumers now buy products such as vitamins, protein powders, and probiotics through e-commerce platforms. Unlike prescription medications, dietary supplements are not strictly regulated before they are sold, which means consumers often rely on visible product information when making purchasing decisions.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) Because of this, attributes such as price, brand reputation, and especially online reviews play an important role in shaping supplement sales online.\n",

    "Previous research on online shopping behavior has consistently shown that customer ratings and reviews have a strong influence on product sales. Chevalier and Mayzlin found that products with higher ratings and more positive reviews tend to sell better, particularly when consumers cannot easily evaluate product quality before purchase.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) This highlights how social proof becomes more important when buyers face uncertainty, which is often the case for health-related products like dietary supplements.\n",

    "We hypothesize that price, customer ratings, review count, and brand are significantly associated with dietary supplement sales. Specifically, we expect review count and average rating to be positively associated with sales, price to be negatively associated with sales, and sales to differ across brands. Among these attributes, we hypothesize that review count will exhibit the strongest positive association with sales. We define “sales” as either total units sold, revenue generated, or sales rank, depending on data availability.\n",

In particular, the number of reviews may serve as an indicator of product popularity and trustworthiness, making consumers more likely to purchase items that appear widely used or endorsed by others."
